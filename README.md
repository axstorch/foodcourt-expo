# Crave - Food Solutions

Crave is a smart food ordering application designed to streamline and enhance the campus dining experience. It allows students and staff to pre-order meals, choose between dine-in or takeaway, and pay online, significantly reducing queue times and delays during peak hours. Each vendor has a unique interface to manage orders, and the app supports seamless UPI payments directed to individual food court stalls. With real-time updates and an intuitive interface, FoodCourt optimizes efficiency and convenience across multiple campus locations.

## ðŸš€ About Me
Iâ€™m a B.Tech CSE student passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. With a strong foundation in full-stack development, I enjoy building apps that make everyday experiences smoother and more efficient. I recently co-developed FoodCourt, a campus-based food ordering app designed to reduce queues and delays by enabling students to pre-order meals, choose dine-in or takeaway, and pay directly via UPI.

I specialize in frontend development using React and React Native (Expo), and collaborate effectively on backend systems, working with tools like Supabase. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and take on projects that blend innovation with impact.

## Lessons Learned

While building Crave, I learned how to structure and manage a full-stack application in a collaborative environment. On the frontend, I deepened my understanding of React Native (Expo) for building responsive UIs and handling navigation and state. I also gained hands-on experience with Supabase, especially in setting up and querying databases, managing user sessions, and implementing role-based access. Integrating UPI payments through Razorpay taught me how to handle real-world payment workflows securely and efficiently.

Working in a team taught me the importance of code modularity, clear communication, and version control (Git) when working on interconnected features.

### Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them:

- Backend Knowledge Gap:
Initially, my partner and I were both new to backend development, which slowed down the early stages. We overcame this by dividing responsibilities â€” I focused on frontend and database logic while my partner upskilled in Supabase and vendor side, and we frequently synced our progress.

- UPI Integration for Multiple Vendors:
Handling payments where each vendor has a unique UPI ID was tricky. We resolved this by dynamically mapping each order to the correct UPI endpoint using Razorpayâ€™s notes feature and our Supabase schema.

- Real-time Updates & Order Management:
Ensuring that vendors could track incoming orders live required learning about real-time subscriptions in Supabase. After testing different approaches, we implemented real-time database triggers to reflect order changes instantly in the dashboard.

- UI/UX Optimization for Students:
Since we built the app for a campus environment, we had to ensure the app was lightweight, intuitive, and mobile-first. We iterated on the design based on peer feedback and focused on reducing taps to complete key actions.
